Q: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When you are working with others on a shared repository. Or when you think you will be working on a repo from more than one computer. Or maybe just because you don't trust your own backup regime.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Because it forces you to write commit messages and think about what you're comitting when and why.
